2025-03-15 ~ I can post

I finally got this to work. I had to do some exploring and fix the yml script that wasn't allowing my github actions to run correctly.
It turns out I was using 'main' instead of 'master'. Oh well. Now, I should be able to just create an html file, commit, and see it autopopulate!
